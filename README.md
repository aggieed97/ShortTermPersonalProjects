# Short Term Personal Projects
Quick and Dirty Projects

The purpose of this repository is to show some projects that I've worked on, usually alongside others, that are smaller in nature than any other project.  Usually they entail very little visualization and basic EDA; basically want to go from original dataset to modeling as quickly as possible usually with the simplest of models.
