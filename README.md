# Short Term Personal Projects
Quick and Dirty Projects

The purpose of this repository is to show some projects that I've worked on, usually alongside others, that are smaller in nature than any other project.  Usually they entail very little visualization and basic EDA; basically want to go from original dataset to modeling as quickly as possible usually with the simplest of models.

1.  Avocado Price Analysis using SARIMAX (September 15, 2018)
2.  West Texas Intermediate and Brent Crude Analysis using SARIMAX (October 28, 2018)

## December 30, 2018 Update
I haven't updated this particular repo in a couple of months, but that doesn't mean I haven't been working on projects.  I've spent the majority of the last few months working on NFL Fantasy Football Projections.  In the last month I've also started working on predicting who will win a football game based on various inputs.  You can read more about that and any other thoughts I have on various subjects at my website: https://salcorpenterprise.com

I do have several ideas on different projects I want to work on in the future.  Here are a few of those ideas in no particular order:

1.  Football Play-by-Play analysis - may end up putting this off until next summer
2.  Update WTI and Brent Crude Analysis based on Q4 data and project out through Q1 2019
3.  Update Avocado Price Analysis through end of 2018 - may be dependent on when that data is available
4.  Triangular Distribution Post - I'm taking a Supply Chain Analytics class from MIT on the eDX platform, and they introduced the concept of triangular distribution.  This was not something that was taught in my Data Science Bootcamp and not many people seem to be familiar with it in my circle.
5.  NCAA Basketball - All the football analysis, of course, is basically setting up my predictions for the NCAA Tournament in March...of course!
6.  Google Maps API - Been meaning to figure out how to use this and incorporate it into the basketball predictions
7.  Fitbit Data - I'd read a blog post on using Fitbit's API to access your data and analyze it
8.  2018 Movie Box Office post concentrating on analysis and visualization.

That's a small handful of the projects that are currently on my wish list of things I'd like to accomplish in the next few weeks/months.
